# Extensions

> In addition to being highly customizable, Directus has also been built with many modular extension points throughout
> the App, API and CLI.

- [Interfaces](/extensions/interfaces/)
- [Displays](/extensions/displays/)

## API Extensions

- [Endpoints](/extensions/api-endpoints)
- [Hooks](/extensions/api-hooks)
